===========


### Running the Project Locally
After installing dependencies, activate your virtual environment and run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Creating a Superuser
To create a superuser account, run:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

### Accessing the Admin Panel
Once the superuser is created, you can access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Log in using the superuser credentials you just created.
